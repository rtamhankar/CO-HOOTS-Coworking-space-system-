# CO-HOOTS-Coworking-space-system
Information systems analysis and design project that includes all the stages of SDLC and other business analysis components such as problem statement, business needs, business requirements, business value, use cases, data flow diagrams, User interface design.

## Business Need
A lot of freelancers and startup have been coming out with brilliant project ideas but lack the place and facilities to work on their projects. The project of Co-working space has been initiated to develop a system which will provide freelancers and startups with the option of renting an office space and supporting facilities to work seamlessly on their projects. This system will help users rent office space on a daily, monthly or yearly basis with the option of renting the facilities present at the office space.

**Freelancers**: Co-working spaces create the best of both worlds for freelancers. The flexibility of choosing your own hours and schedule without isolation. These shared spaces are thus great for freelancers. A feeling of community is created for those that would otherwise be forced to work alone at home or a coffee shop.

**Start-Ups** : Start-ups appreciate the flexibility of coworking spaces. Coworking spaces donâ€™t come with the high costs and commitments of a traditional office lease. This system will provide the chance for small teams to interact with others in the space. These spaces also may even help entrepreneurs find a co-founder for their start-up by connecting the right people at the right time.

## Project Scope
The scope of this system is to have an efficient system which will help the start-ups and freelancers who want to rent the office space on daily/monthly/annual basis. The website has been designed using wix.com
